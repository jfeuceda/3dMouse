# DIY 3D-Mouse

This is a very easy project for those of us who like to design your own stuff in any CAD platform. I use FreeCAD so the keys are program to respond with FreeCAD, but you can change it to accommodate to your CAD software of preference.

Hardware wide you just need the following:

- Arduino pro micro
- Joystick
- Encoder
- Some pieces of thin gauge wires (I used 24gg)
- PLA plastic
- Access to a 3D printer
